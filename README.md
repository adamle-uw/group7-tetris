## Group 7 - TCSS 305B

### Group Members:
+ Evan Abrahamson
+ Aryan Damle
+ Martha Emerson
+ Keegan Sanders

### Sprint 1 Contribution:
####    // brief description of each group member's contribution to Sprint 1
+ **Evan** created a temporary blank window to see the bar, and added a menu bar to the top with a few options, game which contains new game, pause game, and exit game, about which contains help and controls, and options which doesn't contain anything specific yet. Evan also added basic functionality in printing to console just to make sure it works correctly.
+ **Aryan** Created the GUI panel where the game would be visible. Set 3 regions and colored them as per the Sprint1 deliverable instructions. Did some pair programming with Martha and decided that using a nested Frame would be more ideal for the 'NextPiece' panel. Instead of the 'NextPiece' panel's height  being the entire length of the GUI, it will be exactly half the height of the GUI to make the layout less cluttered. 
+ **Martha** (did some stuff and also) created the initial readme template with basic formatting.
+ **Keegan** (did some stuff and also) added some functionality (specify...) to the menu bar. Keegan also formatted and styled the readme.

### Sprint 1 Comments:
####    // use to inform Charles of any issues, ideas, code weirdness, etc.
 + **Aryan** None at this time.
