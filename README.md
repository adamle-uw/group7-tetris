## Group 7 - TCSS 305B

### Group Members:
+ Evan Abrahamson
+ Aryan Damle
+ Martha Emerson
+ Keegan Sanders

### Sprint 1 Contribution:
+ **Evan:** Created a temporary blank window to see the bar. Added a menu bar to the top with a few options: **Game** (contains new game), **Pause Game**, **Exit Game**, **About** (contains help and controls), and **Options** (doesn't contain anything specific yet). Added basic functionality in printing to console just to make sure it works correctly.
+ **Aryan:** Created the GUI panel where the game would be visible. Set 3 regions and colored them as per the Sprint1 deliverable instructions. Did some pair programming with Martha and decided that using a nested Frame would be more ideal for the 'NextPiece' panel. Instead of the 'NextPiece' panel's height  being the entire length of the GUI, it will be exactly half the height of the GUI to make the layout less cluttered. 
+ **Martha:** Created the GUI layout and arranged the visible content area of the GUI window into three main regions: the Tetris board, the next piece display area (a square), and the miscellaneous info area. Did some pair programming with Aryan and worked together on troubleshooting issues with the GUI layout. Created the initial readme template with basic formatting.
+ **Keegan:** (did some stuff and also) added some functionality (specify...) to the menu bar. Formatted and styled the readme.

### Sprint 1 Comments:
+ We formed two programming pairs this week: Evan and Keegan worked together on the menu, and Aryan and Martha worked together on the GUI.
